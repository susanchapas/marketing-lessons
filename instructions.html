<!-- 
You are an expert Front-End Developer and UX Designer creating a visually striking, WCAG 2.2 AA compliant, single-page educational website about the "Outlaw" brand archetype. 
The design should be fluid, animated, and highly responsive — with smooth scroll-to navigation and section-based layout transitions.

Goals:
- Create a single-page website that feels cinematic and rebellious — dark mode by default.
- Use HTML, CSS (or Tailwind), and vanilla JS (or minimal GSAP/Framer Motion if available).
- Design must be WCAG accessible: sufficient color contrast, ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigability, focus states, and descriptive alt text.
- The website must look sleek, edgy, and modern — large typography, bold animation, asymmetrical layouts, parallax or scroll effects.
- The information should appear in interactive and eye-catching ways — fade-ins, slide-ins, hover distortions, kinetic typography, or glitch effects.

Structure:
1. **Header:** fixed to top, transparent until scroll. Contains logo/title and navigation links. 
   Navigation links scroll smoothly to their corresponding sections.
2. **Hero Section:** dramatic fullscreen intro with bold headline (“Rules Were Made To Be Broken”) and animated background (e.g., subtle glitch, smoke, or flashing red/black gradient).
3. **Definition & Core Traits:** dark section with red highlights and large text revealing each trait with staggered animations.
4. **Visual Identity Guidelines:** grid-based layout showing color palette swatches, font previews, and example imagery (graffiti, fists, chains). Add hover tooltips for each explanation.
5. **Brand Voice & Messaging:** split-screen layout. Left side: example slogans/words animate in (“Defy”, “Revolution”, “Unapologetic”). Right side: short paragraph explaining tone.
6. **Real Brand Examples:** 3-card section with hover effects, logos, and links to Liquid Death, Harley-Davidson, and Diesel. Each card includes short descriptive copy and a source link.
7. **Application to Our Business Category:** parallax-style background with bold typography overlay explaining how the archetype fits and why it attracts loyal audiences.
8. **Implementation Ideas:** alternating text and image panels (asymmetrical). Include examples of dark-mode layouts, graffiti textures, or “No B.S.” messaging.
9. **Footer:** compact, with “Research Sources” list (links open in new tabs). Include ARIA labels and social icons. Footer should fade in when scrolled to bottom.

Visual Identity:
- **Primary Colors:** Black (#000), Red (#FF0000)
- **Accents:** White (#FFFFFF), Charcoal Gray (#2E2E2E)
- **Typography:** 
  - Headers: "Bebas Neue", sans-serif — bold, condensed, uppercase.
  - Body: "Anonymous Pro", monospace — minimal, industrial.
- **Imagery:** gritty urban textures, graffiti, unfiltered portraits.
- **Mood:** raw, high-contrast, rebellious, with hints of danger and defiance.

Interactions & Animation:
- Scroll animations: fade, skew, parallax, or glitch effects.
- Hover effects: image distortion or text flicker.
- Scroll progress indicator.
- Animated anchor transitions.
- Use prefers-reduced-motion media query for accessibility.

Deliverables:
- Fully responsive layout (mobile → widescreen)
- Modern semantic HTML5 structure
- CSS organized with comments and variables for color/font reuse
- Accessible JS for scroll and animation triggers
- Footer with working external links and sources.

Include comments explaining each section and maintain readable, production-quality structure.
Use comments like: 
  <!-- SECTION: Definition and Core Traits -->
  <!-- SECTION: Brand Voice and Messaging -->
  
Make sure the end result feels like a rebellious, motion-rich educational microsite that still meets accessibility and performance best practices.
